# Orderly startup and shutdown validation

`native/native_application.h` now tracks SDL and Wicked initialization
separately. A failed startup closes callback admission, runs registered unwind
hooks, stops Wicked audio while SDL is live, waits for any available GPU work,
destroys the Wicked application, clears the global graphics device, destroys
the window, and quits SDL. The destructor and explicit shutdown share this
idempotent rollback path.

`native/window_lifecycle_probe.h` injects failures after SDL setup, after window
creation, and after Wicked initialization. For each point the native gate checks
that the window, SDL subsystems, and Wicked graphics device return to baseline,
then retries initialization and shuts the host down successfully. A separate
thread holds an admitted callback while shutdown closes admission; the test
checks that the callback drains before reverse-order shutdown hooks execute.
The existing repeated-host test still performs two full hidden init/shutdown
cycles.

Validation on the pinned SDL3/Wicked Metal build:

```text
DEVELOPER_DIR=/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools \
ELISA_ALLOW_STALE_STAGE1=1 ~/.local/bin/elisascript scripts/wicked_probe.elisascript
```

Result: exit status 0; both native frame passes verified topology and exact
determinism, and frame time stayed within budget. F05 remains partial: general
service registration and allocator-pressure accounting across real shutdown
remain to be implemented; this probe does not establish those contracts.
